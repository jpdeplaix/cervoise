### Requirements

* Boehm GC: libgc-dev on debian.
* Clang
* The latest OPAM and the latest OCaml (https://opam.ocaml.org/)

### Installation

```
$ opam pin add cervoise .
```

### Usage

Examples of the syntax or features can be seen in the `examples` directory

To compile an example you have to use the following command:

```
$ cervoise build-program --src-dir examples Hello
```

Just replace `Hello` by the name of the module you want to compile (such as `TyClass` or `Fact`)

Then you can execute the resulting program with:

```
$ ./a.out
```

To know more about the compiler options, use the `--help` argument like:

```
$ cervoise --help
$ cervoise build-program --help
```


Enjoy !
